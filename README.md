Smart Contract Overview

The contract implements the following key functionalities:
1. MintNFT

Allows the contract owner to mint new NFTs with a unique token ID and a URI that points to the token's metadata.

solidity

function MintNFT(string memory _tokenURL) public onlyOwner returns(uint256);

2. listNFT

Allows the owner of an NFT to list the token for sale at a specified price.

solidity

function listNFT(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price) public;

3. purchaseNFT

Allows users to purchase an NFT by sending Ether equal to the listed price. The ownership is transferred to the buyer, and the seller receives the payment.

function purchaseNFT(uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

4. getNFTListing

Allows users to retrieve details about an NFT that is listed for sale, including the seller's address, the listing price, and whether the NFT is currently listed.
